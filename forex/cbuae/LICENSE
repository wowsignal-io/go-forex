Open Data Policy 
Our definition of open data is information (data) that anyone can access, use, distribute, modify and share for any purpose without any technical, financial or legal restrictions. For transparency and accountability, the Central Bank of the UAE gives everyone — developers, researchers, media, and the public — access to our data.
When you use the data, it is important to mention the document’s source and follow any copyleft licence requirements. 


What is copyleft? 
A copyleft licence allows anyone to copy, modify and distribute intellectual property (IP) freely under the terms stated.

Where a copyright licence restricts the freedom to copy, modify and distribute IP, a copyleft licence provides this freedom.  

We encourage you to share your opinion and feedback on the open data that we provide through our surveys, polls, and social media.
